    "A full-stack challenge combining a Java backend with a TypeScript frontend. It implements a system for managing students and orders using REST API, demonstrating object-oriented design, data handling, and interactive UI functionality. The project showcases integration between a strongly-typed backend and a responsive frontend, with practical use of collections, classes, and user input management.",

    description: "Instead of storing flag images directly in the codebase, the application retrieves them dynamically from an external API. This keeps the project lightweight, avoids shipping large static assets, and allows flags to stay accurate and up to date without additional maintenance. The result is a faster-loading, more scalable solution that emphasizes efficient data usage and thoughtful performance trade-offs.",
